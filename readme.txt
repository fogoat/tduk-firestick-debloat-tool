What is bloatware?

When you unbox your new phone / Android device, it comes with Android that is pre-installed by the manufacturer. This is termed as “stock firmware”. Stock firmware also comes with a number of apps pre-installed, like native browser, Google apps, games, etc. Some applications are manufacturer-specific. For example, many Samsung phones come with Samsung Health and Galaxy Apps pre-installed, which are available only in Samsung devices. Often, the user doesn’t require these applications, as they are mostly inferior when compared with similar apps available elsewhere. You can disable them from Settings, but they will continue to take up space on your eMMC. Such apps are then termed as “bloatware”. The process of removing the APK and data files of the bloatware is called “debloating”.
